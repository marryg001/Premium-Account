## Using Your Website

The website features a clean, modern interface with a prominent Black Friday banner displaying the "FRIDAY50" discount code for 50% off all purchases. Browse the product catalog by clicking "Browse Products" or "Products" in the navigation menu. Each product card displays the service name, description, annual price, and key features. When you find a product you want, click "Get Started" or "Purchase Now" to proceed to checkout.

On the checkout page, enter your email address in the provided field. The system accepts only Gmail, Proton Mail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, or Outlook addresses to ensure reliable delivery. If you have a voucher code like "FRIDAY50" or "MONDAY60", enter it in the voucher field and click "Apply" to see your discount applied immediately. Review your order summary showing the original price, discount amount, and final total before clicking "Proceed to Payment".

After confirming your order, you'll see an invoice with your unique order number and complete payment instructions. The page displays multiple cryptocurrency wallet addresses with QR codes for different blockchain networks including BNB Smart Chain, Solana, Avalanche, Ethereum, and Base. Choose your preferred network, scan the QR code or copy the wallet address, and send the exact amount shown in USD equivalent.
